Thank you for downloading this scene.

This is a quick preset to generate and edit some cloud-like volumes. 

Please switch off the bool "realize instances" in the geometry node settings for quick performance while editing the cloud shape. 
Then, once finished, turn on again to properly display the clouds volume in cycles. Please see the video example



thanks
